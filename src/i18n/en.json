    "event1949Desc": "ROC government relocated to Taiwan",
    "event1949Detail": "On December 7, 1949, the ROC government relocated from Chengdu to Taipei, marking the beginning of long-term cross-strait division. Since then, both sides developed different political, economic, and cultural paths, beginning decades of separation.",
    "event1949ExtendedDetail": "This migration resulted from the outcome of the Chinese Civil War. As the People's Liberation Army advanced, the Nationalist government decided to move its political center to Taiwan, using the Taiwan Strait as a natural barrier. This move not only changed Taiwan's political status but also profoundly affected cross-strait relations for decades to come.",

    "event1979Detail": "On January 1, 1979, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China issued the 'Message to Compatriots in Taiwan', formally proposing the 'peaceful reunification, one country two systems' policy toward Taiwan. This was the first formal call for peaceful reunification made by mainland China to Taiwan since 1949.",
    "event1979ExtendedDetail": "This document marked a major shift in China's Taiwan policy from 'armed liberation' to 'peaceful reunification'. The document proposed stopping artillery shelling of islands like Kinmen and called for 'three links' - trade, transportation, and postal services - between the two sides. Although Taiwan was still under martial law at the time, this document laid the foundation for future cross-strait exchanges.",

    "event1987Detail": "On November 2, 1987, Taiwan's government announced the opening of civilian visits to mainland China, ending 38 years of isolation. This breakthrough opened a new chapter in cross-strait civilian exchanges.",
    "event1987ExtendedDetail": "After this policy was implemented, hundreds of thousands of veterans who came to Taiwan with the Nationalist government in 1949 were able to return home to visit relatives. Many families separated for nearly 40 years were finally reunited, creating moving scenes. This was not only a reunion of families but also an important milestone in the thawing of cross-strait relations, opening the door for subsequent economic, cultural, and academic exchanges.",

    "event1992Detail": "In 1992, the Straits Exchange Foundation and Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits reached an oral consensus on the 'One China' principle in Hong Kong. This laid the political foundation for subsequent cross-strait negotiations.",
    "event1992ExtendedDetail": "The core of the 1992 Consensus is 'One China, different interpretations'. Taiwan believes 'One China' refers to the Republic of China established in 1912, while mainland China believes it refers to the People's Republic of China. Despite the interpretative differences, this consensus did facilitate the 1993 Wang-Koo talks, becoming an important political foundation for official cross-strait contact.",

This was the first formal, public, high-level official contact between the two sides since 1949, regarded as an important milestone in cross-strait relations.",
    "event1993ExtendedDetail": "During the talks, both sides signed four agreements: 'Agreement on the Use and Verification of Cross-Strait Notarization', 'Agreement on Cross-Strait Registered Mail Inquiry and Compensation', 'Agreement on the System of Contact and Talks between the Two Organizations', and 'Common Agreement of the Wang-Koo Talks'. Although the talks did not touch on political issues, they established a mechanism for institutionalized cross-strait consultation, laying the foundation for future exchanges and cooperation.",

This was the first formal visit to mainland China by a leader of a major Taiwanese political party since 1949, called the 'ice-breaking journey'.",
    "event2005ExtendedDetail": "During this visit, Lien traveled to Nanjing, Beijing, Xi'an, and Shanghai, and held talks with Hu Jintao at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Both sides issued the 'Common Vision for Cross-Strait Peaceful Development', proposing to promote comprehensive economic exchanges across the strait and establish cross-strait economic cooperation mechanisms. This visit opened formal exchanges between the KMT and CCP and paved the way for improved cross-strait relations after the KMT's return to power in 2008.",

    "event2008ExtendedDetail": "The implementation of the Three Links significantly shortened travel time and reduced transportation costs between the two sides. In terms of shipping, cargo ships from both sides could travel directly without detouring through a third location. In terms of air transport, direct flights between the two sides greatly improved the convenience of personnel exchanges. After this policy was implemented, cross-strait economic and trade exchanges became more frequent, and tourism also flourished.",

    "event2014Detail": "On March 18, 2014, hundreds of Taiwanese university students occupied the Legislative Yuan to protest the review process of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement. This 23-day student movement reflected Taiwanese society's concerns about the rapid development of cross-strait relations and marked a rethinking of cross-strait policy by Taiwan's younger generation.",
    "event2014ExtendedDetail": "The Sunflower Movement erupted because students believed the review process of the Service Trade Agreement lacked transparency and worried that the agreement would impact Taiwan's economy and employment. During the movement, students demanded 'legislation first, review later', which ultimately prompted the Legislative Yuan to pass the Cross-Strait Agreement Supervision Act. This movement not only affected the progress of cross-strait economic and trade agreements but also profoundly changed how Taiwanese society discusses cross-strait relations.",

    "event2015ExtendedDetail": "This meeting was held at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore. During the talks, both sides reaffirmed the importance of the 1992 Consensus and exchanged views on the peaceful development of cross-strait relations. Although the meeting was brief, it was an important milestone in cross-strait relations history. After the meeting, cross-strait relations showed signs of easing, but with Taiwan's change of government in 2016, cross-strait relations became tense again.",

    "event2019ExtendedDetail": "In his speech, Xi Jinping clearly stated that he would not renounce the use of force, but emphasized that this was targeted at external interference and a very small number of Taiwan independence separatists. He proposed exploring a 'two systems solution for Taiwan' and called on political parties and various sectors from both sides to nominate representative figures to conduct extensive and in-depth democratic consultations on cross-strait relations and the future of the nation. This speech was seen as an important declaration of China's Taiwan policy and also sparked widespread discussion in Taiwanese society.",

Changes in the international situation and the evolution of the internal political environment on both sides will all affect future development directions. Whether it is peaceful reunification, maintaining the status quo, or other possible development paths, they all require the wisdom and joint efforts of people on both sides. The wheel of history continues to move forward, and the future of cross-strait relations remains full of uncertainty, but peace and prosperity remain the greatest common denominator for people on both sides.",
